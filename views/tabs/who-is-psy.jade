  Park Jae-sang

.content.
  PSY (short for "psycho") is the stage name for Park Jae-sang,
  the creator of <i>Gangnam Style</i>. Born on December 31,
  1977, the now <div class="psy-age">35</div> year old Park
  has had his fair share in the spotlight before <i>Gangnam Style</i>. 
  Raised by an affluent family in the Gangnam District of 
  Seoul, South Korea, his father is an executive of a large 
  manufacturing corporation and his mother owns several
  restaurants in Gangnam. PSY initially planned to take over
  his father's corporation and attended Boston University
  in pursuit of a degree in business administration. However,
  he soon became disinterested with his studies.  
  PSY said in an interview that he fell in love with music
  at the age of 15 and was inspired by Queen's 
  Bohemian Rhapsody, so when he could no
  longer stand to remain at the university, he dropped
  out in pursuit of musical ventures. He debuted as 
  a performer on South Korean television in 2000 
  after catching the eye of a TV producer, and he had
  been modestly famous until <i>Gangnam Style</i>.<div class="citation"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psy">8</a></div>

  Controversy and Peculiarity

.content.
  PSY is far from the typical factory-made Korean pop 
  star; he is much more organic and far from perfect. He may be 
  too far from perfect though. Before his rise to
  global fame, PSY's life and career were not empty
  of notable shortcomings:
  <ul>
    <li>
      In 2001 he was caught for possession
      of maijuana and put in jail for 25 days. He was later
      fined for the same incident.
    </li>
    <li>
      When PSY released his first alum in 2001, he was fined
      by the South Korean government because the contents
      of the album were deemed inappropriate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Due to explicit content his second album was 
      prohibited from being sold to the under-19 market,
      because authorities were afraid of the negative 
      impact it might impose on the younger generation.
    </li>
    <li>
      At the beginning of his career, PSY was dubbed 
      "The Bizarre Singer" due to his explicit lyrics,
      strange dancing, and non-factory appearance.
    </li>
    <li>
      In 2003 he was enlisted in the South Korean military
      but he managed to be excused from his duties by 
      finding a position at a software company because the
      SK government grants pardons to those working
      in engineering or technically-related fields for
      the benefit of the government. However, during the
      time of his "employment", he released his fourth
      album. He was found guilty of neglecting his duties
      in 2007 and served in the military until 2009.
    </li>
    <li>
      PSY has admitted to a drinking problem.
    </li>
    <li>
      He participated in an anti-American concert after
      the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangju_highway_incident">Yangju highway incident</a>,
      fueling the anti-American sentiment of the time.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Despite all the rough patches and gray areas in his career,
  PSY has found a niche in the South Korean music industry and
  was hailed early on because of his controversial 
  songwriting and peculiar style.<div class="citation"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psy">8</a></div>
  <br /><br />
  In South Korean pop culture, this niche is labeled "gwang-dae",
  and the performers that comprise this category are 
  individiuals born to aristocracy or high-profile government 
  who perform comical and satirical acts to uncover 
  the underlying truths of their birthrights.<div class="citation"><a href="http://theairspace.net/commentary/south-koreas-fool-oppa-is-gangnam-style/">9</a></div>
  For PSY, <i>Gangnam Style</i> is his greatest 
  achievement, the pinnacle of his artistry.<div class="citation"><a href="http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/10/psy_reddit_ama.php">10</a></div>

  What is "Oppan Gangnam Style"?

.content.
  The iconic quote of the song and now a part of 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yale_Book_of_Quotations">
  The Yale Book of Quotations</a>, "Oppan Gangnam Style" can be 
  loosely translated "Big brother is Gangnam Style" (in South Korean 
  culture, females use the term "oppa" when addressing 
  their older brothers or older male friends). "Big brother" refers
  to PSY, but what does it mean to be "Gangnam Style"?

  The Gangnam District

.content.
  Before we can understand what "Gangnam Style" is,
  we first need to know what Gangnam is. The 
  Gangnam District is basically the Beverly Hills
  of South Korea. To put things 
  in perspective, the district spans 15 square miles
  and its entire real estate is worth more than 
  that of Busan's, South Korea's second largest city;
  Gangnam has a population of 527,641,(as of the 2010 census) 
  Busan has 3.6 million.<div class="citation"><a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/09/20/2011092000357.html">11</a></div><div class="citation"><a href="http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/10/psy_reddit_ama.php">12</a></div><div class="citation"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busan">13</a></div>
  Naturally, Gangnam is home to the richest conglomerates 
  of South Korean (e.g. Samsung,
  Hyundai, YG Entertainment), collectively known as 
  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol">chaebol</a>".
  In more US vernacular, Gangnam is the 1 percent 
  (recall the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement">
  Occupy Movement </a> and the 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_the_99%25">
  99%</a>).

  Gangnam Style is For Posers

.content.
  Thus the term "Gangnam Style" is a neologism referring to
  the oppulent lifestyle of those living in the 
  Gangnam District of Seoul. Gangnam is a South Korean metonym 
  for aristocracy and the elite, and the younger South
  Korean generation call themselves "Gangnam Style"
  when they wish to convey that they too fit in with
  this high profile crowd. In <i>Gangnam Style</i>,
  PSY calls himself "Gangnam Style", because he 
  and the horse trot dance look anything but.<div class="citation"><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Music/south-korean-rapper-psys-gangnam-style-viral/story?id=16996559">14</a></div>
  He is making fun of those people who actually use
  the term to place themselves into 
  class and elitism when they can ill-afford to.
  "Through the video and the lyrics, 
  it’s easy to tell PSY is acting for
  archetypical wannabeism—he is a chubby
  guy who is anything but aristocratic 
  trying to make it in the Gangnam world. 
  But PSY is the one making the jokes, 
  not the punch line. He cuts to deeper truths."<div class="citation"><a href="http://theairspace.net/commentary/south-koreas-fool-oppa-is-gangnam-style/">15</a></div>

  Can We Hear the Message?

.content.
  Unfortunately, PSY's pointed satire
  is lost on most of the US audience. US listeners
  likely know little Korean (if any at all) and
  even less about Gangnam. <i>Gangnam Style's</i>
  message is targeted towards South Korea, 
  the US need not appreciate
  it for the message, it need not know <i>who</i>
  PSY is, merely <i>what</i>.<div class="citation"><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/14/us-korea-uncool-idUSBRE87C05R20120814">16</a></div>
